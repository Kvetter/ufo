# Code Analysis

## Exercise 1

We have chosen to look for the following 10 checks

1. System.Out.Println()
  This is a common thing for a developer to do which working on the project, but it is unesseary for the system to do System.Out.Println's
  instead it should be replaced with a log.
2. Unused imports
3. Unused variables
  There is no need for unused code.
4. Long Comments
  We want to keep our code clean, nice and simple. Therefore we want to reduce the needs for complex comments.
5. Visibility Modifier
  We want to look for all public variables to see if we can make them private or protected.
6. Method Name
  We want to make sure that our methodes follows the convention we have decleard for our project.
7. One Statement Per Line
  We want to make sure our code is easy readable for everyone.
8. Outer Type Filename
  It makes sense to only have one class per file. We want to make sure that the class name and filename is the same.
9. Empty Catch Block
  We want to handle exceptions properly and log them.
10. For Loop Can Be Foreach
  To ensure that we loop through all elements, we want to use the foreach loop instead of a for loop.
